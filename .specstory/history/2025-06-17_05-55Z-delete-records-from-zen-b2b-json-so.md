# Delete records from ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO (2025-06-17 05:55Z)

_**User**_

@Codebase 在把ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO_TMP資料insert到ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO之後，我要再下一句SQL
DELETE FROM ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO
WHERE STATUS = 'W' AND INVOICE_NO IN (
    SELECT INVOICE_NO FROM ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO WHERE STATUS = 'S'
);

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering the Sequence**

I'm thinking about the sequencing of operations. I've successfully placed the insert statement from `ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO_TMP` to `ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO`. Now, I'm carefully considering where the additional SQL statement fits, ensuring it executes after the insert but before the transaction concludes. I'm focusing on preserving data integrity.


**Analyzing the Codebase**

I'm now examining the `StatusUpdateService` in detail. It seems that the insert from `ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO_TMP` to `ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO` doesn't happen directly within this service. Instead, it seems to handle status updates and a cleanup process after the data is already inserted. The `*_extract.sql` files appear to be responsible for the initial data insertion into `ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO_TMP`. I'm trying to determine where and how to integrate the requested delete statement within the existing transactional flow, without disrupting the integrity of the data.


**Refining the Approach**

I've been re-examining the `StatusUpdateService` and its relation to the requested SQL statement. It's now clear that it primarily handles status updates, not the initial data insertion. My focus has shifted to identifying the service responsible for the insertion from `ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO_TMP` to `ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO`. The `OutboundService.java` is likely where this happens. I will confirm this by reviewing the `*_extract.sql` files for clues about how the status is updated. I need to consider how to execute the delete within the existing transactional boundaries of the insert operation for optimal performance.


**Investigating the Data Flow**

I'm now tracing the data flow. After populating `ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO_TMP` via the extract SQLs, the critical insert into `ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO` must occur. I'm focusing on identifying the service responsible for this crucial step.  I need to locate the exact point where the INSERT happens to insert the delete statement.


**Locating the Insertion**

I'm now zeroing in on the insertion process. The `StatusUpdateService` handles updates *after* the initial data is processed, which confirms the suspicion that `OutboundService` or a similar service is responsible for the insertion from `ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO_TMP` to `ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO`. I need to review the code more carefully to determine the specific class and method executing this critical insert statement and identify the transaction boundary.


**Tracing the Data Path**

I'm currently trying to trace the complete data insertion path, from the initial `*_extract.sql` files to the final data insertion. The `StatusUpdateService` handles updates *after* insertion, which means I should search for the insert logic elsewhere. I'm focusing on the interaction between these SQL files and the subsequent service that processes the inserted data, keeping the requested delete statement's placement in mind.


**Refining the Insertion Point**

I've determined that the insert doesn't happen directly in `StatusUpdateService`. The service handles status updates. The extract SQLs populate a temporary table, and a separate process must then insert this data into the primary table. I'm focusing on locating the service responsible for this intermediate step. The transactional nature of `updateStatus` suggests that the deletion should be added there when status is updated to 'S'.


**Revising the Status Updates**

I'm now focusing on where to integrate the user's deletion request within `StatusUpdateService`. The service primarily updates statuses in `ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO`, triggered after data is *processed*, not inserted. My reasoning leans toward placing the delete statement within `updateStatus` after status updates occur. I'm exploring how to incorporate this safely and efficiently to ensure data consistency.


**Revisiting the Transaction**

I've determined that the `StatusUpdateService`'s `updateStatus` method is the most appropriate place to incorporate the user's deletion logic. Since the insert doesn't happen directly in this service, I've decided to add the delete statement after the status updates, specifically when the transaction flag is 'S' (success). This will ensure that the delete operates within the transaction.


**Finalizing the Integration**

I've determined that the user's deletion request aligns perfectly with the `updateStatus` method in the `StatusUpdateService`. This method is transactional, making it a safe place to incorporate the cleanup logic. After updating status to 'S', I will add the DELETE statement to the `if ("S".equals(transFlag))` block, ensuring that it executes only upon successful transactions and maintaining data consistency. I'm now testing it.


**Confirming the Logic**

I'm checking that the deletion occurs after a successful transaction (`transFlag = 'S'`) in the `updateStatus` method of `StatusUpdateService`. The implementation should handle the user's deletion request within the service's transactional boundaries, ensuring data consistency and cleanup.


**Clarifying the Placement**

I'm focusing on the insertion point within the transaction. I've re-evaluated that `StatusUpdateService` handles status updates post-insertion.  I'm now zeroing in on precisely where the `INSERT` operation happens, and where the deletion query needs to be placed. The `OutboundService` seems highly likely to be the source. The status is likely updated after `ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO` is inserted.

\n\n**Investigating Outbound Service**

I'm investigating the `OutboundService` for the initial data insertion and confirming the transaction boundaries. My current focus is to determine the exact method responsible for moving data from the temporary table to the primary table. It seems that the `OutboundService` handles the  insert into the `ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO` table directly. The subsequent status update confirms my suspicion about transaction placement.

\n\n**Confirming the Scope**

I've confirmed that the insertion occurs within `OutboundService.java`. My focus now shifts to pinpointing the specific method and transaction boundary for integrating the deletion query. To determine the correct flow, I will examine `insert`, and ensure the delete operation occurs within the same transactional context.

\n\n**Pinpointing the Insertion**

I've located the insertion logic within `OutboundService` and confirmed the presence of transaction management.  I'm now identifying the most suitable point to add the deletion query, ensuring that it executes after the successful insert but before the transaction completes. I will examine the transaction boundaries and determine the specific `try-catch` blocks and the appropriate place.

\n\n**Integrating the Deletion**

I've pinpointed the insertion method in `OutboundService` and am now ready to integrate the deletion query. To maintain data consistency, I will add the DELETE statement within the existing transaction block, ensuring that it only executes after the insert completes successfully. I'll test it after integrating.

好的，我了解您的需求。我將在 `StatusUpdateService.java` 中新增一段邏輯，當訂單狀態成功更新為 'S' 之後，刪除 `ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO` 表中具有相同 `INVOICE_NO` 但狀態仍為 'W' 的多餘紀錄。

這可以確保對於已成功處理的出貨通知，不會再重複發送。

這是我為您做的修改：

```java:src/main/java/com/znt/outbound/service/StatusUpdateService.java
// ... existing code ...
        int updatedSoRows = jdbcTemplate.update(soSql, transFlag, formattedTimestamp);
        log.info("ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO 表狀態已更新。共 {} 筆訂單狀態更新為 '{}'", updatedSoRows, transFlag);


        if ("S".equals(transFlag)) {
            String deleteWaitingSql = "DELETE FROM ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO " +
                                      "WHERE STATUS = 'W' AND INVOICE_NO IN (" +
                                      "    SELECT INVOICE_NO FROM ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO WHERE STATUS = 'S'" +
                                      ")";
            int deletedWaitingRows = jdbcTemplate.update(deleteWaitingSql);
            if (deletedWaitingRows > 0) {
                log.info("成功清理了 {} 筆狀態為 'W' 的重複訂單紀錄。", deletedWaitingRows);
            }
        }

        String cleanupSql = "DELETE FROM ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO " +
                            "WHERE ID IN ( " +
                            "    SELECT DISTINCT ID " +
// ... existing code ...
```

我已經在 `updateStatus` 方法中，於更新 `ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO` 狀態之後，加入了您指定的 `DELETE` 邏輯。這個刪除操作只會在 `transFlag` 為 'S' (成功) 時執行。

如果您還有其他需要修改的地方，請告訴我。

_**User**_

@Codebase 不對，應該是在我執行extract.sql之後，並且把資料寫入ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO之後執行。
為的是 當同一筆 INVOICE_NO 已有成功(S)紀錄時，刪除ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO中等待中(W)的紀錄

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning the Deletion**

I'm currently devising a plan for the SQL `DELETE` statement. My goal is to ensure it executes flawlessly after the `extract.sql` scripts and the data migration from `ZEN_B2B_JSON _SO_TMP` to `ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO` are complete. I'm exploring the codebase to identify the ideal integration point for this deletion operation.


**Implementing the Deletion**

I've pinpointed the optimal location for the `DELETE` statement: within `LoadService.java`, specifically following the data transfer from the temporary table to the main table. The placement ensures the deletion occurs after the `extract.sql` scripts and the data migration from `ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO_TMP` to `ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO` are finished, exactly as I intended. I am now preparing the integration of the SQL code.


**Confirming Implementation Point**

I've re-examined the code and confirmed that `LoadService.java` within the `loadFromTmpToMain` method is indeed the correct location. This placement guarantees the `DELETE` operation runs after the `extract.sql` scripts and the data migration from `ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO_TMP` to `ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO` are both successfully completed.  I'm now focusing on integrating the specified SQL statement into the appropriate section of this method.


**Integrating the Delete Statement**

I'm now integrating the `DELETE` statement into `LoadService.java`, specifically within the `loadFromTmpToMain` method, after the data transfer from the temporary table and the existing cleanup. The new SQL will target records marked 'W' if a successful 'S' record exists for the same invoice number, as per the user's requirement. I'll place it directly after the existing cleanup code, ensuring the correct sequence of operations.


**Verifying Implementation Logic**

I'm now carefully examining the proposed placement and the logic of the SQL statement. I want to be certain that the execution order and the specific SQL conditions are precisely aligned with the user's requirements.  I'm focusing on ensuring the new `DELETE` statement correctly removes any 'W' records for invoices that already have a successful 'S' record, and that this happens after the `extract.sql` scripts and the data migration, but before any further processing.


**Refining Implementation Strategy**

I'm now carefully examining the proposed placement and the logic of the SQL statement, specifically within `LoadService.java`. My aim is to ensure the new `DELETE` statement correctly removes 'W' records for invoices with existing 'S' records, and that this happens after the data migration but before further processing of the data. I'm focusing on ensuring the correct execution order of the operations, taking into account the impact of the data extraction scripts and data migration.


**Finalizing the Implementation**

I've clarified the implementation logic with the user and integrated the SQL `DELETE` statement into `LoadService.java`. The statement will remove 'W' records for invoices that already have a successful 'S' record, ensuring data integrity and preventing reprocessing of successful invoices. This change follows the extraction and loading steps, as requested. The code is placed after the data migration and existing cleanup operations, ensuring the correct sequence and intended outcome.


**Finalizing Implementation Logic**

I've integrated the `DELETE` statement into `LoadService.java` within the `loadFromTmpToMain` method, ensuring it executes post-data migration. This placement, after the extraction and insertion process, aligns with the user's intent to remove 'W' records for invoices with existing 'S' records, preventing redundant processing. The updated SQL execution safeguards data integrity.


**Implementing the Logic**

I've integrated the proposed SQL `DELETE` statement into `LoadService.java` to eliminate 'W' records for invoices with existing 'S' records after data migration, per the user's requirements. This change guarantees the desired outcome. The logic is now in place and ready for testing, and aligned with user feedback.


**Implementing the Final Cleanup**

I've integrated the final logic to remove 'W' records for invoices with existing 'S' records within `LoadService.java`. This ensures that after the data migration from the temporary to the main table, we eliminate any potentially erroneous 'W' records that may have been generated. The SQL code is now integrated, and it's ready for testing.


**Revising the Implementation**

I'm now integrating the `DELETE` statement within the `loadFromTmpToMain` method in `LoadService.java`. My updated approach ensures this operation directly follows the data transfer from the temporary table to the main table, effectively eliminating redundant 'W' records for invoices with existing 'S' records and adhering to the user's specific requirement. I will make sure the logic is correct.


**Implementing the Cleanup Logic**

I'm now integrating the `DELETE` statement within `LoadService.java` to remove redundant 'W' records for invoices with existing 'S' records after data migration, specifically within the `loadFromTmpToMain` method. This will follow the data transfer and existing cleanup, ensuring the correct data state for processing. The integration is performed in the dedicated method.


**Confirming the Final Code**

I've integrated the SQL `DELETE` statement into `LoadService.java`, within the `loadFromTmpToMain` method, ensuring it executes after data migration and cleaning up 'N' records but before further processing. The logic will remove 'W' records for invoices that already have a successful 'S' record, ensuring data integrity and correct processing flow, per the user's requirements.

好的，感謝您的澄清。我理解了，這個刪除操作是為了資料清理，確保已經成功傳送 (狀態 'S') 的發票，不會因為後續從來源系統重複撈取而產生新的待處理 (狀態 'W') 紀錄，從而避免重複傳送。

這個邏輯確實應該放在 `LoadService` 中，在從暫存表 (`ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO_TMP`) 載入資料到主表 (`ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO`) 之後執行。

我將修改 `src/main/java/com/znt/outbound/service/LoadService.java` 來實現您的需求。

```java:src/main/java/com/znt/outbound/service/LoadService.java
// ... existing code ...
                int deletedRows = jdbcTemplate.update(cleanupSql);
                log.info("成功清理了 {} 筆過時的 'N' 狀態紀錄。", deletedRows);

                log.info("開始清理已有成功(S)紀錄的待處理(W)訂單...");
                String deleteWaitingIfSuccessfulSql = """
                    DELETE FROM ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO
                    WHERE STATUS = 'W' AND INVOICE_NO IN (
                        SELECT INVOICE_NO FROM ZEN_B2B_JSON_SO WHERE STATUS = 'S'
                    )
                    """;
                int deletedWaitingRows = jdbcTemplate.update(deleteWaitingIfSuccessfulSql);
                log.info("成功清理了 {} 筆已有成功紀錄的待處理訂單。", deletedWaitingRows);

                return null;
            } catch (DataAccessException e) {
                log.error("從 TMP 表載入資料到主表時發生錯誤，交易已回滾。", e);
// ... existing code ...
```

我已經在 `loadFromTmpToMain` 方法的交易區塊中，加入了您指定的 SQL 邏輯。這會在資料載入後，但在交易提交前執行，確保資料的一致性。

這樣修改後，程式會在每次資料抽取和載入後，自動清理掉不應再被處理的待辦事項。如果沒有其他問題，我就完成了。

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Examining the Build Failure**

I've examined the user's query and Maven build log. The core issue revolves around a failure during the `test` phase, with the `maven-surefire-plugin` reporting an error. I'm focusing on the root cause of this failure to suggest appropriate solutions. Further breakdown shows test method results.


**Diagnosing the Missing Configuration**

I've pinpointed the `java.lang.IllegalStateException` as the crux of the issue. The tests cannot locate the main Spring configuration. Digging deeper, it appears the Spring Test context runner is struggling to find the `@SpringBootConfiguration` upwards from the test class. I'm investigating potential classpath issues or misconfigurations in the project structure.


**Identifying the Configuration Location**

I've determined that the `OutboundApiApplicationTests` class, in a separate package (`com.znt.outbound_api`) from the application's presumed main package, is the root cause of the error. The Spring test context runner, by default, searches upwards from the test class's package to find the `@SpringBootConfiguration`. Since the packages are separate, the context fails to load. My focus is now on confirming the application's entry point and then assessing whether this test class needs refactoring to co-exist in the same application package.


**Proposing a Package Structure Fix**

I've determined that the test class's package, `com.znt.outbound_api`, is the root of the problem. Spring's auto-configuration isn't finding the main application context because the test class isn't in a sub-package of it. My solution involves moving the test class to `com.znt.outbound`, which is the correct practice for Spring Boot tests. This ensures Spring's component scanning can discover the main application configuration. I am proposing this refactor.


**Recommending a Package Structure Fix**

I've examined the root cause, and I'm proposing the user move the test class, `OutboundApiApplicationTests`, into the `com.znt.outbound` package to match the application's main package, as it's currently located in `com.znt.outbound_api`. This allows Spring Boot's test context to correctly locate the application's configuration. The IDE can guide the user through the process, which is the standard practice for Spring Boot tests.


**Resolving the Package Conflict**

I've examined the user's Maven build log, and I've determined the `IllegalStateException` is due to a package name conflict. The test `OutboundApiApplicationTests` currently resides in `com.znt.outbound_api`, but the application's main configuration likely uses the `com.znt.outbound` package, as inferred from the code in `LoadService.java`. The fix involves changing the test class's package declaration. The IDE will probably prompt the user to move the file after the change.


**Correcting Test Configuration**

I've determined that the build failure stems from a Spring context loading issue. The `OutboundApiApplicationTests` class, currently in the `com.znt.outbound_api` package, can't find the application's main configuration. This happens because the test class package doesn't align with the application's root package, which is likely `com.znt.outbound`. I propose correcting the test class's package declaration.

好的，我看了您提供的 Maven package 錯誤日誌。

這個錯誤**不是**由您剛剛在 `LoadService.java` 中新增的 SQL 邏輯引起的。這是一個 Spring Boot 測試設定的問題。

**問題分析：**

1.  **錯誤訊息**：`java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to find a @SpringBootConfiguration by searching packages upwards from the test.` 這句話的意思是，Spring 在執行測試時，找不到您的主應用程式設定（也就是帶有 `@SpringBootApplication` 註解的那個類別）。
2.  **根本原因**：Spring Boot 的測試框架會從測試類別所在的套件（package）開始，向上搜尋主設定檔。
    *   您的應用程式主要程式碼位於 `com.znt.outbound` 套件中 (例如 `com.znt.outbound.service.LoadService`)。
    *   但是，您的測試類別 `OutboundApiApplicationTests` 卻位於 `com.znt.outbound_api` 這個不同的套件中。
3.  **結論**：因為 `com.znt.outbound_api` 和 `com.znt.outbound` 是兩個不同的套件路徑，測試框架在 `com.znt.outbound_api` 裡面找不到主設定，所以就報錯了。

**解決方案：**

我們需要將測試類別的套件名稱更正為與主應用程式的基礎套件一致。也就是將 `package com.znt.outbound_api;` 改為 `package com.znt.outbound;`。

我將為您修改這個測試檔案。請注意，修改後，您的 IDE (如 IntelliJ) 可能會提示您「將檔案移動到對應的資料夾」，**請選擇移動**，這才是正確的做法。

**檔案路徑**： `src/test/java/com/znt/outbound_api/OutboundApiApplicationTests.java`

```java:src/test/java/com/znt/outbound_api/OutboundApiApplicationTests.java
package com.znt.outbound;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;

@SpringBootTest
class OutboundApiApplicationTests {

    @Test
    void contextLoads() {
    }

}
```

修改完成後，請再次執行 Maven package，問題應該就能解決。

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Management Guidelines

**Essential Workflow for Every New Conversation:**
1. Always read `PLANNING.md` at the start of every new conversation
2. Check `TASKS.md` before starting your work
3. Mark completed tasks in `TASKS.md` immediately
4. Add newly discovered tasks to `TASKS.md` when found

## Project Overview

This is a Spring Boot application for JIT (ÊÅ©ÂèäÈÄö) WMS system integration that provides warehouse management automation and data synchronization. The application acts as a bridge between Zenitron's internal systems and JIT's WMS APIs.

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Spring Boot 3.5.0
- **Language**: Java 17
- **Database**: Oracle DB (B2BDB on 10.1.1.15:1521)
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Authentication**: Token-based auth with JIT APIs
- **Communication**: HTTPS/REST APIs with JSON payloads

## Development Commands

### Build and Run
```bash
# Build the application
mvn clean compile

# Run tests
mvn test

# Package the application
mvn clean package

# Run the application
mvn spring-boot:run
# or
java -jar target/outbound-api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### Database Operations
```bash
# Check Oracle connection (via application startup logs)
# Database settings are in src/main/resources/application.properties
# Connection: jdbc:oracle:thin:@10.1.1.15:1521:B2BDB
```

### Log Files
- Logs are stored in `logs/` directory relative to JAR file
- Main log file: `znt-outbound-api.log`
- Logging level for com.znt package: INFO

## Architecture Overview

### Core Modules

**Authentication Layer**
- `JitAuthService`: Token management with automatic refresh and caching
- `JitApiClient`: HTTP client with auth token injection and retry logic

**Business Services**
- `JitAsnMappingService`: Handles ASN (ÂÖ•Â∫´ÂñÆ) creation and processing
- `JitInvMoveOrTradeMappingService`: Manages inventory movement and trading operations
- `JitInvLocService`: Provides inventory location queries with batch processing and error handling

**Configuration Management**
- `ApiConfigService`: Database-driven configuration loader from `ZEN_B2B_TAB_D` table
- Uses provider name pattern: `{PROVIDER}-{CONFIG_TYPE}` (e.g., `JIT-LOGIN_URLT`)

**Scheduling System**
- `JitAsnScheduledTask`: Automated ASN processing every 5 minutes (currently disabled for testing)
- `JitInvMoveOrTradeScheduledTask`: Automated inventory operations processing
- `JitInvLocScheduledTask`: Daily inventory location queries at 2:00 AM (currently disabled pending JIT API access)

**Data Models**
- Package `com.znt.outbound.model.jit.*`: JIT API request/response DTOs
- Package `com.znt.outbound.model.json.*`: Feiliks format models

### Key Design Patterns

**Configuration Pattern**: All API endpoints and credentials are stored in Oracle database table `ZEN_B2B_TAB_D` with naming convention:
- `JIT-LOGIN_URLT`: Login API URL
- `JIT-ASN_URLT`: ASN creation API URL  
- `JIT-MOVE_TRADE_URLT`: Move/Trade API URL
- `JIT-INV_LOC_URLT`: Inventory location API URL
- `JIT-LOGIN_USERNAME` / `JIT-LOGIN_PASSWORD`: Authentication credentials

**Error Handling Pattern**: 
- Comprehensive logging with task IDs for traceability
- Automatic token refresh on 401 responses
- Exception categorization with specific handling suggestions

**Scheduled Task Pattern**:
- Configurable scheduling with enable/disable flags
- Detailed execution logging with performance metrics
- Comprehensive error handling and system diagnostics

## Important Implementation Notes

### Authentication Flow
1. `JitAuthService.getAuthToken()` checks cached token
2. If no token, calls `loginAndGetToken()` using credentials from database
3. Token is cached using `AtomicReference` for thread safety
4. On 401 responses, token is cleared and retry attempted

### Database Configuration
- Provider name is configurable via `logistics.provider.name` property (default: JIT)
- All API endpoints loaded from `ZEN_B2B_TAB_D` table on application startup
- Configuration service validates required fields and logs warnings for missing optional ones

### Scheduling System
- ASN processing: Every 5 minutes (cron: `0 */5 * * * ?`)
- Currently disabled via `schedulingEnabled = false` flag for testing
- All scheduled tasks include comprehensive logging and error handling

### JIT API Integration Points

**ASN Creation**: `/wms/b2b-api/create-asn-by-api`
- Creates inbound notifications (È†êÂÆöÈÄ≤Ë≤®ÈÄöÁü•ÂñÆ)
- Supports multiple warehouse zones (ZSH Âü∫ÈÄö.‰∏äÊµ∑ÂÄâ, ZSH Âü∫ÈÄö.‰∏çËâØÂÄâ, etc.)
- Handles batch attributes (LotAttr01-20)

**Inventory Operations**: `/project/b2b-api/inv-move-or-trade`
- Move: Internal warehouse transfers within same account
- Trade: Cross-account inventory transactions

**Inventory Query**: `/project/b2b-api/get-inv-loc-list`
- Multi-dimensional inventory queries (warehouse, zone, storer, SKU)
- Returns up to 5000 records per query with batch processing (500 records per batch)
- Includes batch attributes and aging information (56 fields supported)
- B2B envelope integration with email notification system
- Comprehensive error handling with retry protection

## Testing

### Test Controllers
- `JitTestController`: Provides endpoints for testing JIT API integrations
- Includes manual trigger endpoints for scheduled tasks
- Located at `/jit-test/*` endpoints

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test ASN processing
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/jit-test/process-asn

# Test inventory move/trade processing  
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/jit-test/process-move-trade

# Test inventory location query
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/jit-test/process-inv-loc

# Test scheduled task execution
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/jit-test/run-asn-schedule
```

## Configuration Files

### application.properties
- Server port: 8080 (configurable)
- Oracle database connection settings
- Mail server configuration (tp.zenitron.com.tw:25)
- Logging configuration
- Jackson JSON serialization settings

### Database Tables
- `ZEN_B2B_TAB_D`: System configuration storage
- Query pattern: `T_NO = 'JSON_SYS_INFO'` for API configurations

## Important Security Notes

- JIT API credentials are stored in database, not in code
- HTTPS required for all JIT API communications
- Sensitive data logging is avoided
- Token caching uses thread-safe atomic operations

## Common Development Workflow

1. **Adding New JIT API Integration**:
   - Create request/response DTOs in `model.jit` package
   - Add API URL configuration to database (`ZEN_B2B_TAB_D`)
   - Implement service method in `JitApiClient`
   - Create mapping service for business logic
   - Add scheduled task if needed
   - Create test endpoint in `JitTestController`

2. **Debugging API Issues**:
   - Check logs for task IDs and trace request flow
   - Verify database configuration in `ApiConfigService`
   - Test token refresh in `JitAuthService`
   - Use test endpoints for manual verification

3. **Database Schema Changes**:
   - Update relevant DTO classes
   - Modify SQL queries in service classes
   - Test with Oracle database connection

### JIT Inventory Move/Trade Interface Testing & Optimization Session (2025-07-18)

**Objective**: Test and optimize the JIT inventory move/trade interface that was made available for testing, resolve critical issues, and ensure production readiness.

**Phase 1: Interface Testing**

**Initial Testing:**
- Tested JIT inventory move/trade interface using manual project startup and Postman
- Endpoint tested: `GET http://localhost:8080/api/test/jit/process-and-send-inv-move`
- Initial API response: HTTP 400 BAD_REQUEST with error "ÊòéÁªÜË°åÁöÑÊñôÂè∑‰∏çÂêàÊ≥ïÔºöBD48K42G-TL"

**Critical Issue Identified:**
- **Infinite Loop Problem**: System continuously retried failed API calls with 400 errors
- **Root Cause**: SQL query `select_inv_move_for_jit.sql` included both 'PENDING' and 'FAILED' status, causing perpetual reprocessing
- **User Impact**: Console log flooding and potential system instability

**Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis**

**Technical Investigation:**
- Analyzed `JitInvMoveOrTradeMappingService.java` processing logic
- Identified that 400 BAD_REQUEST errors (client errors) should not trigger retries
- Discovered SQL query design allowed failed records to be continuously reprocessed
- Confirmed need to maintain 'FAILED' status querying for scheduled task business continuity

**Business Requirements Validation:**
- Scheduled tasks must reprocess 'FAILED' records every 5 minutes for business continuity
- Manual testing should have limited retry attempts to prevent infinite loops
- System must gracefully handle invalid data without affecting overall stability

**Phase 3: Solution Design & Implementation**

**Retry Protection Mechanism:**
```java
// Èò≤Ê≠¢ÁÑ°ÈôêÂæ™Áí∞ÁöÑÊ©üÂà∂
java.util.Set<String> recentlyFailedExternalNos = new java.util.HashSet<>();
String lastFailedExternalNo = null;
int sameDataFailCount = 0;
final int maxSameDataFails = 2;

// Intelligent loop termination
if (sameDataFailCount >= maxSameDataFails) {
    log.warn("ExternalNo: {} ÈÄ£Á∫åÂ§±Êïó {} Ê¨°ÔºåÊú¨Ê¨°Âü∑Ë°åË∑≥ÈÅé", externalNo, sameDataFailCount);
    recentlyFailedExternalNos.add(externalNo);
    break; // ÁµêÊùüËôïÁêÜÂæ™Áí∞
}
```

**Key Implementation Features:**
- **Consecutive Failure Detection**: Tracks repeated failures for same ExternalNo
- **Execution Session Scope**: Limits failures per execution session, not globally
- **Graceful Degradation**: Skips problematic records while continuing processing
- **Business Continuity**: Maintains scheduled task ability to retry failed records

**Files Modified:**
1. `JitInvMoveOrTradeMappingService.java` - Added retry protection mechanism
2. `JitAsnMappingService.java` - Applied consistent retry protection pattern

**Manual Testing Results:**
- ‚úÖ Infinite loop eliminated - system now limits retries to 2 attempts per session
- ‚úÖ Console log flooding resolved - changed from `continue` to `break` for proper termination
- ‚úÖ API response controlled - single attempt per manual test execution
- ‚úÖ Error handling improved - graceful degradation without system instability

**Scheduled Task Testing:**
- ‚úÖ Confirmed scheduled task functionality works correctly
- ‚úÖ Validated business continuity - failed records still reprocessed in subsequent runs
- ‚úÖ Performance impact minimized - retry protection prevents resource exhaustion

**Phase 5: Production Readiness**
